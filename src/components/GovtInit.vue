                    <li>Owners who register fully electric cars will receive a rebate of 45% off the Additional Registration Fees (ARF), with a cap at $20,000.</li>
                    <li>The minimum Additional Registration Fee (ARF) for electric cars will be lowered from $5,000 to $0 from January 2022 to December 2023.</li>

                This will lower the upfront cost of an electric vehicle by an average of 11%.<br><br>

                        will be built into the road tax schedule for EVs’, since they do not contribute to fuel excise duties.</li>
                    <li>Revising the road taxes for EVs will ensure that mass-market EVs will have a comparable road tax as 
                        compared to their equivalent Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) counterparts.</li>
