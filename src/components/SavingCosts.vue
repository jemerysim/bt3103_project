            Firstly, you can save on energy costs.
            <ul>
                <li>The following table shows the potential yearly savings you can get from driving an EV, as compared to a petrol-powered one.</li>
            </ul>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Car Model</th>
                    <td>Hyundai Ioniq Electric</td>
                    <td>Hyundai Avante</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Energy consumption</th>
                    <td>11.7 kWh/100km</td>
                    <td>6.7 litres/100km</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Annual energy cost</th>
                    <td>$454.75</td>
                    <td>$2,345</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Savings</th>
                    <td>$1,890.25</td>
                    <td>-</td>
                </tr>

            Secondly, you can save on maintenance costs as well. 
            <ul>
                <li>EV maintenance consists mostly of ensuring the electric and power systems are healthy (the onboard systems should do that already), brake pads and brake fluid are fresh, and tyres are usable.</li>
                <li>As EVs run cleaner than petrol cars (which have engines that basically explode the fuel in them to get the wheels turning), thereâ€™s less volatile reactions, and less wear and tear.</li>
                <li>Hyundai says, "Compared to a 1.6-litre class, petrol-driven family sedan, the Ioniq Electric will save you more than $5,000 in maintenance over a 10-year, 200 000km ownership period."</li>
                <li>Renault also says a Zoe owner can save $1,300 on service at 30,000km (only one service is needed, compared to three for a normal car)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            In addition, the government has been rolling out many initiatives to reduce the cost of owning an EV. Click on the rebates and grants tab above to find out more!
