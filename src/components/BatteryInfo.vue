            Most EVs comes with at least 8-years of battery warranty that guarantees above 80% capacity.
        </li>
        <li>
            The rate of degradation depends on vehicle, battery type and usage but in general EV owners can expect a typical degradation of 1.5% per year.
        </li>
        <li>
            While there is some capacity degradation occurring, this is not the same as efficiency degradation. 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The capacity degradation causes slightly less energy to be stored in the battery cells, and slightly less energy to be available for the EV motors. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    But this does not mean that it takes more energy to drive the EV. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Thus, the efficiency degradation is negligible. Even if the battery capacity would degrade naturally over time, the overall efficiency of the vehicle will not be impacted.
        </li>
    </ul>
