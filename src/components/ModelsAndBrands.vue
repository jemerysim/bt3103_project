            It is important to select the right EV that meets your needs.
            <ul>
                <li>Besides the price, some other factors to take into consideration would be the EV's range (how long the car can travel on a full charge) and the EV's power consumption (how much electricity it uses up to travel 100km).</li>
                <li>Different makes and models have different range and power consumption. If you’re looking to save costs, an EV with a lower power consumption would be better. However, if you regularly drive long distances, you might want to invest in an EV with a higher maximum range.</li>
            </ul>
